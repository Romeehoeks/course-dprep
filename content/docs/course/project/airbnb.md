# Data

## Kick-starting the team project with data from Airbnb

At the moment I am working on a project for Data prep.

## Inside Airbnb

The team project draws on datasets from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/amsterdam/) which is an independent open-source data tool developed by community activist Murray Cox who aims to shed light on how Airbnb is being used and affecting neighborhoods in large cities. The tool provides a visual overview of the amount, availability, and spread of rooms across a city, as well as an approximation of the number of bookings and occupancy rate.

This data set allows for a variety of research questions, such as:
- How has the Airbnb market in Amsterdam responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of bookings per neighborhood?
- What percentage of hosts violates the [30-day-per-year rule](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/860/amsterdam) imposed by the municipality of Amsterdam? What characterizes these accounts?
- How did the Airbnb market expand geographically? Which neighborhoods are upcoming, and which ones have been popular from the start?
- Do professional hosts (i.e., accounts with multiple listings) charge higher prices on average? What is their estimated income per month?
- What are the most popular cities Airbnb cities across Europe? Are those cities also the most expensive cities? Where can you go on vacation and get *good value for money*?
- How do market prices respond to changes in supply and demand? What's the typical price mark-up during the holiday periods?

## Download the data

The data is available per city (e.g., Amsterdam) and entity (e.g., listings, calendar, reviews, neighbourhoods, etc.).
